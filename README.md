# DD2367-Quantum-Chemistry
This is the final project of Samuil Donchev and William Galvin for Autumn 2023 DD2367 Quantum Computing for Computer Scientisits at KTH Stockholm. 

In this project, we explore the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and its applications to computational chemistry, particularly in solving the electron structure problem. 

In `/paper` we present an overview of our findings, in `/pennylane` we use an off-the-shelf library and tutorial to demonstrate the VQE with different molecules, and in `/vcvqe` we present a "very classical variational quantum eigensolver" that gives a lower level, less practical window into the VQE for quantum chemistry. See their READMEs for more information and usage instructions.
